/**
 * The Host half's HTTP surface.
 *
 * The browser half has no Cordis context and no remote namespace of its own, so
 * every question it asks the Host crosses a same-origin route registered on the
 * `webServer` carrier. Each route answers JSON and never rejects: a transport or
 * sandbox failure becomes an `{ ok: false }` result the page reports in its error
 * dialog.
 *
 * The Host stays authoritative about *where* Git runs. A request may name the
 * session it belongs to, but never a directory: the directory is read from that
 * session's own header — from the live session when the Host holds it, and from
 * the session's durable header when it does not yet — so a page cannot point the
 * plugin at a repository the session does not own. The durable read is what lets
 * a reopened page's Git tab answer for its own repository on the first request,
 * which arrives while the session is still being resumed (see `resolveTarget`).
 *
 * It is equally authoritative about *how much* Git may write. Each request's
 * file policy is resolved from the same session and carried on every command, so
 * a write route runs under exactly the mode and workspace root that session
 * already has — never under a deployment fallback that would refuse it. A session
 * that is not live yet has no such policy to resolve, so its routes may read but
 * never write.
